# Description
This project is intended to used on a soldering iron rack. It uses a simple temperature sensor or thermoresistor to detect temperature and turns on an LED light and beeps an piezo buzzer occationally to indicate that the soldering iron is on. The purpose of the project is to solve the problem of me constantly forgetting to unpluging the soldering iron.
Required components:
 * ATTiny13
 * SOP to DIP converter
 * 3mm LED light
 * 220 ohm resistor
 * piezo buzzer
 * thermoresistor
